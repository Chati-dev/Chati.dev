# Code of Conduct

## Rules

1. **Be respectful** — Disagree with ideas, not people. No personal attacks.
2. **Be constructive** — Bug reports need reproduction steps. Feature requests need use cases. PRs need tests.
3. **Stay on topic** — Issues and discussions are for Chati.dev. No spam, no self-promotion, no off-topic debates.
4. **Do your homework** — Search existing issues before opening a new one. Read the docs before asking questions.
5. **Write quality code** — Follow existing patterns. Include tests. Pass lint. Keep PRs focused.

## Enforcement

Violations result in comment removal, issue lock, or ban — at the maintainer's discretion.

Report issues via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chati-dev/Chati.dev/issues).
