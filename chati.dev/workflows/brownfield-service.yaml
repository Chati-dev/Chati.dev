# Brownfield Service Workflow
# Backend/API enhancements for existing projects

workflow:
  id: brownfield-service

  description: >
    Pipeline for backend/API changes in existing projects.
    Same as brownfield-fullstack but Architect focuses on
    API design, data model, and service architecture.
    UX agent runs in minimal mode (API documentation only).
