    Development pipeline for existing projects. Key difference from greenfield:
    Architect comes BEFORE Detail to understand existing constraints first.
    brownfield-wu ALWAYS runs Deep Discovery with 3 scout calls.

phases:
  - phase: 0
    name: Deep Discovery
    category: CLARITY
    sequence:
      - agent: brownfield-wu

        notes: >
          Both axes (technical + operational). ALWAYS runs Deep Discovery
          with 3 scout calls: Architect, UX, QA in scout mode.
